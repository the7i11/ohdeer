# 3D-Printed Case

For the sake of simplicity, the case is coming directly out of a 3D-Printer.
If you don't have one on you own, you might wan't to ask someone who does.
As with the other hardware, I (currently) cannot provide them to anyone I don't know personally.

## How to print

Printing in PETG will generally have a higher weather resistance than PLA. However, PLA will not immediately dissolve in rain - it can withstand even more than a year ouside without turning into compost.

### Lid

- `lid.stl`
- Printed transparently
- Extrusion factor bumped up by 3%-5% (better transparency)

### Base Case

- `base_case.stl`
- Printed in bright orange to be easily visible in the green grass
